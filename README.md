# Tribute Page for Ern≈ë Rubik
This website is a tribute page for [Erno Rubik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ern%C5%91_Rubik), the inventor of the Rubik's cube.
I chose to make this page because I enjoy solving Rubik's Cubes, 
and I also thought that I could make a fun design using the cube as inspiration.

## Free Code Camp and School of Code
The page fulfills the user stories for the [Free Code Camp Responsive Wed Design Project #1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page).
It was also created and hosted on Github as part of the [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk)'s pre-course work.

## Development Process
First I made a simple HTML/CSS layout to fulfill the Free Code Camp user stories. I also added a background using **linear gradients** inspired by the design of the Rubik's Cube.
I decided to put the biographical information into a 3x3 grid to also look like a cube. This was a good opportunity to use **CSS Grid** which I haven't used in many projects but want to get more comfortable with. I also added some simple **Javascript** to change the cube squares to a random color when the mouse hovers above them. I used Javascript to change a CSS variable.

## Next Steps
* I attempted to make the design responsive, but want to work more on that. I am not sure if my media queries are working as intended.
* I would love to make a playable Rubik's Cube! If not an animated one, at least one that can change colors to function like a real cube. This is out of the current scope of the project, however!
