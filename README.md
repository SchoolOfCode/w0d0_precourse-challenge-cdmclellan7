# Tribute Page for Ern≈ë Rubik
This website is a tribute page for [Erno Rubik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ern%C5%91_Rubik), the inventor of the Rubik's cube.
I chose to make this page because I enjoy solving Rubik's cubes, 
and I also thought that I could make a fun design using the cube as inspiration.

## Free Code Camp and School of Code
The page fulfills the user stories for the [Free Code Camp Responsive Wed Design Project #1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page).
It was also created and hosted on Github as part of the [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk)'s pre-course work.
